# scratchpad
A minimalist yet powerful document editor.

Scratchpad is a new kind of document editor. The goal of Scratchpad is to provided a distraction-free place to write, and to make it easy to create rich, highly interactive documents.

Features:

 - text formatting
 - research
 - find in page
 - components you can add to documents (images, charts, maps, embeds, videos). More of these to come!
 - dropbox integration


In the future:

 - more interactive components
 - a more powerful find in page (regex, find+replace)

# How to use

Create a new dropbox app at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/. <br>
Replace DROPBOX_APP_KEY with your new app's app key. <br>
Replace standaert.net/scratchpad with the location you will place scratchpad in. <br>
Upload the app to a server and add the url of the scratchpad directory to the OAuth redirects list in the dropbox app console.
